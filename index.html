        <h3><strong>Women and Child Safety Device</strong></h3>
        <p>Womens and child safety is a very important issue due to rising crimes against women these days. To help resolve this issue I designed a gps based womens and child safety system that has dual security feature. This device consists of a system that ensures dual alerts in case a woman or a child is harassed or she thinks she is in trouble. This system can be turned on by the user in case she even thinks she would be in trouble. It is useful because once an incident occurs with a woman or child, they may or may not get the chance to press the emergency button. In a button press alerting system, in case a woman is hit on the head from behind, she may never get the chance to press panic button and no one will know she is in trouble. Our system solves this problem. This device is to be turned on in advance by a woman in case she is walking on a lonely road or some dark alley or any remote area. Only the woman authenticated to the devices can start the system by fingerprint scan. Once started the devices requires the woman to constantly scan her finger on the system every 1 minute, else the system now sends her location to the authorized personnel number through SMS message as a security measure and also sounds a buzzer continuously so that nearby people may realize the situation. In this case even if someone hits the woman or the woman falls down and get unconscious, she does not need to do anything, the system does not get her finger scan in 1 minute and it automatically starts the dual security feature. This device will prove to be very useful in saving lives as well as preventing atrocities against women. The device uses GPS sensor along with a GSM Modem, LCD Display, LEDs and microcontroller based circuit to achieve this system.</p>

        <h3><strong>Portable Health Monitoring Device</strong></h3>
        <p>With the rapid medical development of our modern societies, the healthcare systems are becoming much more mature and professional. In order to reduce the current burden of the public health system and promote the popularity of routine health self-check, this technique has been developed for making faster and more accurate pre-diagnoses with ease of use. The pulse test is a painless test, that measures a personâ€™s oxygen saturation level, this health checker device is used to check how well the heart is pumping oxygen throughout the body. It can be applied to check the status of patients with any type of condition, such as pulmonary diseases or COPD, anaemia, lung cancer etc. In such patients, diseases may require constant monitoring and care. In order to take care of this issue, our system comes to the rescue. It is easy to use this portable system which can be carried anywhere by the subject and the relevant parameters will be updated over IoT. This health check system is powered by an Atmega 328 microcontroller which consists of an SPO2 sensor (blood oxygen meter), heart rate sensor, temperature sensor, WIFI module, LCD and adapter.
